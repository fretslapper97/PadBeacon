# PadBeacon

Bridge USB gamepads to Bluetooth using ESP32-S3.

> ![status](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-in%20development-orange)
> **Project Status: In Development / Testing**  
> This is early-stage firmware under active development.  
> Core logic is in place, but the project is not yet functional — hardware is pending.  
> Expect incomplete features, stub code, and placeholder implementations.

## ⚠️ Current Development Stage

- ✅ Licensing and repository structure complete
- ✅ Initial USB input and BLE output logic scaffolded
- 🛠️ USB parsing and HID report formatting **not yet implemented**
- 🧪 All logic currently uses **stub/simulated input**
- ⏳ Awaiting ESP32-S3 hardware delivery for integration testing
- ❌ No functional gamepad transmission at this time

Use this codebase at your own risk — it's a work in progress.
